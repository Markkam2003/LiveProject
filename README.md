# LiveProject #2

# Introduction

For the last two weeks of my time at the tech academy, I worked with my peers in a team developing a full scale MVC Web Application in C#. Working on a legacy codebase was a great learning oppertunity for fixing bugs, cleaning up code, and adding requested features. There were some big changes that could have been a large time sink, but we used what we had to deliver what was needed on time. I saw how a good developer works with what they have to make a quality product. I worked on Back end and Front end stories.Over the two week sprint I also had the opportunity to work on some other project management and team programming skills that I'm confident I will use again and again on future projects.

Below are descriptions of the stories I worked on, along with code snippets.

Create and style About Page:

Here I created an About Page  using Html and styled it using css.

Entity Framework:
After I created the model I used Visual Studio and EntityFramework to create Index, Edit, Create, Details, and Delete pages.

Here I added placeholders to all input fields.
